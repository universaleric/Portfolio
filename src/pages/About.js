                  I’m a web developer living in the great state of Texas. I
                  believe the littlest of details matter, especially when it
                  comes to the feel and function of a website. I strive to
                  create intuitive, delightful experiences that not only look
                  great, but function seamlessly as well.{" "}

                  I’m no stranger to complex problem solving and creating great
                  experiences. In my prior life, I worked in the restaurant
                  industry, triaging problems on the fly, in a fast-paced
                  environment in order to make sure every employee under my care
                  felt supported and every customer left happy.{" "}

                  I prefer to work on collaborative teams where each person can
                  bring their strengths together under a unified vision. How
                  might we get started re-imagining your digital experience?
                  Looking forward to connecting with you soon!
