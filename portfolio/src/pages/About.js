              Hello! I'm a 30 year old web developer hailing from the good ol'
              state of Texas. I love working with others and collaborating to
              make the most of our collective talent. I think the little things
              matter and can make or break the feel and function of a website.
              Oh, and I have a hedgehog as my assistant.
            </p>
